Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning repository! Here, you'll find my latest work exploring advanced statistical techniques, model evaluation methods, and practical implementations in ML.

This repository serves as a collection of my ongoing projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning. From hypothesis testing and estimators to decision tree classifiers and sampling methods to creating custom chatbots, agents, etc., I focus on rigorous experimentation, technical accuracy, and real-world applications.
